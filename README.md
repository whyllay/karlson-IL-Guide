## Resources

`These are the resources necessary to make this possible.`

###
###

- [Level Importer & Unity Package ](https://github.com/Jor02/KarlsonLevelImporter/releases/) by Jor2

This is what we will use to import the level and create our own with it's unity package.

###

- [Unity **2019.2.6**](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive) (

Unity does not like being messed around with on higher version when created in a previous one, such why this is required. (I can't link it directly to the version, so you might need to search for it.)

###

- [BepInEx(64x)](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.21)

> BepInEx is a plugin / modding framework for Unity...

###

- [Project File](https://github.com/whyllay/karlson-IL-Guide/blob/main/assets/TemplateProject.zip?raw=true) by Jor2

This is required due to a unity bug, sorry for the inconvenience.
